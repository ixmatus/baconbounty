**Bacon Bounty** is a modern affiliate management and payout service for your business. We take the pain out of
integrating with your business' signup process (API? Check. JS? Check.) and make it easy to see how much your affiliates
are earning for your business, how much you owe them, and paying them out (including automated W9 forms).

## How much does it cost?

We are in Beta right now, but I intend to make the pricing competitive.

## Integration

From WordPress plugins and shopping cart plugins to drop-in Javascript or a clean developer API, we've made it easy and
fun for you to build or migrate an affiliate network for your business.
